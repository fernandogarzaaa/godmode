Static Reality Check UI. Keep this `index.html` in sync with
`src/eve_miro/api/static/index.html` — FastAPI serves whichever exists
(`apps/dashboard` first, then package static).

Five views: World, Simulation, Experience, Reality Check, Reliability,
plus Market (latest `eve-miro market-sim` run: scenario-class trust table
and per-symbol simulated-vs-observed alignment, fed by
`GET /market/latest`).
One-click **Load demo** calls `POST /demo`.
