/**
 * The CP/1 validation endpoint — how ADAM reaches EVE.
 *
 * ADAM spawns this as a subprocess, writes one line per {@link ValidationRequest}
 * and reads one line per {@link FitnessResult}. Line-delimited JSON over stdio
 * was chosen over HTTP because it needs no listener, no port allocation, no
 * service discovery and no authentication story for the common single-host
 * case — and because a subprocess boundary is a real isolation boundary for a
 * component whose job is running scenarios.
 *
 * Requests are handled strictly in order. Fitness measurement is CPU-bound
 * simulation, so concurrency would not shorten the wall clock, and serializing
 * keeps a request's stdout line unambiguously its own.
 *
 * See `protocol/cp1/SPEC.md` section 6.
