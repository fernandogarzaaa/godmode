EVE is **not** another testing framework, browser-automation tool, or
Playwright wrapper. It is an **autonomous cognitive simulation engine**: a
simulated human — with reading speed, motor precision, memory, emotions,
expectations and a breaking point — sits down in front of your software and
uses it. Then EVE tells you what that experience was like, with evidence.

**Code correctness ≠ good software.** A green test suite proves your
implementation matches your intent. It says nothing about whether a
first-time user can sign up, whether an impatient user survives your loading
states, or whether your error page strands people. Users experience
interfaces, not implementations — EVE validates the experience.

```
$ eve run https://staging.example.com --persona first-time-user --goal "sign up"

  #0 read the screen — New screen — let me look around and figure out what this is.
  #1 click "Get started" — "Get started" matches what I'm trying to do (sign up).
  #2 type "alex@example.com" into "Email address" — This form wants "Email address" — filling it in.
  (made and corrected 1 typo(s))
  #3 click "Create account" — The form is filled in — "Create account" should submit it.
  ...
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Overall experience score : 72/100
  Findings                 : 0 critical, 2 major, 5 other
  Outcome                  : goal-achieved
  Reports                  : .eve-output/report.html
```

## How it works

Every simulated operator runs the **human loop** — never a script:

```
Observe → Interpret → Update Mental Model → Predict → Decide → Interact
   ↑                                                              │
   └── Adjust Internal State ← Compare Prediction vs Reality ← Observe Again
```

Three principles make it a simulation rather than automation:

1. **No privileged information.** The operator perceives only what a human
   perceives: pixels, visible text, the cursor, the URL bar, loading
   indicators. It cannot read your source, your DOM internals, your network
   tab or your logs. This boundary is structural — everything downstream of
   the perception layer literally has no channel to anything else.
2. **A continuously evolving cognitive state.** Goals and subgoals, a mental
   model with predictions, working/episodic/semantic/spatial memory with
   real forgetting, and nine emotions (confidence, frustration, trust,
   confusion, curiosity, fatigue, satisfaction, interest, stress) updated by
   appraisal after every action. Frustration past the persona's tolerance =
   the operator gives up, exactly like your users do.
3. **Prediction as the engine of evaluation.** Before acting, the operator
   predicts the outcome; afterwards, prediction meets reality. The gap
   drives emotion, learning, findings ("expectation violations") and scores.

## What you get

- **17 built-in personas** — first-time user, power user, elderly user,
  keyboard-only accessibility user, color-blind user, impatient user,
  anxious user, curious explorer… each a coherent bundle of 16 behavioral
  traits (reading speed, click accuracy, patience, risk tolerance, memory,
  keyboard preference…) plus custom personas in code or YAML.
- **Autonomous workflow discovery** — login, signup, password reset,
  dashboards, CRUD, settings, search, checkout, wizards… recognized from
  perception alone and mapped into a completion-tracked graph.
- **Visual observation** — WCAG contrast (with color-blindness simulation),
  clipped/overflowing/overlapping/misaligned layout detection, tiny
  text/targets, blank screens, pixel-diff visual-regression on revisits.
- **Evidence-backed scoring** — 16 built-in dimensions (usability,
  learnability, accessibility, efficiency, navigation, workflow quality,
  error recovery, responsiveness, cognitive load, trust…) where every number
  traces to something that happened. Dimensions, finding categories and
  action verbs are registry-backed: domain packs and plugins can register
  new ones without touching core (see [docs/plugin-guide.md](docs/plugin-guide.md)).
- **Rich reports** — self-contained HTML (emotion timeline, interaction
  heatmap, screenshots, session journal with first-person rationale),
  Markdown and JSON. Exit codes make `eve run` a CI gate.
- **Pluggable everything** — browser adapters (Playwright, Puppeteer,
  Selenium, mobile device emulation, offline mock), decision policies
  (offline heuristic mind or an optional Anthropic-powered one), and passive
  plugins (accessibility, performance, LLM design critic, your own).
- **Mobile web** — real device emulation with genuine touch actuation (fat-
  finger tap scatter, swipe momentum, soft-keyboard cadence and occlusion),
  not just a resized viewport. See [docs/mobile-web.md](docs/mobile-web.md).
- **MCP server evaluation** — EVE speaks MCP natively (it *is* an MCP
  server), so it can evaluate other MCP servers: personas operate them
  through the session loop (`eve run "mcp:node server.js"`), and a
  deterministic oracle suite (`eve mcp-eval`) checks schema quality,
  protocol conformance, and robustness under seeded fuzzing. See
  [docs/mcp-adapter.md](docs/mcp-adapter.md).
- **Reading, not just driving** — `eve read` puts a simulated reader in front
  of any *digital output*: reports, decks, analytics exports, `--help`
  screens, CI logs, API payloads. It measures whether the reader understood
  it — terms defined before use, figures that assert something, numbers with
  a baseline, an ending that says what to do — and it is genuinely
  persona-relative. See [docs/humanity-adapter.md](docs/humanity-adapter.md).
- **Conversations, not just interfaces** — `eve chat` puts a simulated person
  in front of anything that *answers back*: a support bot, an LLM copilot, a
  voice assistant. It measures the things people actually complain about —
  replies that answer a different question without admitting it, how many
  times they had to rephrase, whether there was ever a route to a human — and
  it rephrases and gives up the way a real person does. See
  [docs/conversational-adapter.md](docs/conversational-adapter.md).
- **Pixels, not just markup** — EVE reads the DOM, which is what a page *says*
  about itself, and separately reads what actually reached the screen. The
  findings live in the gap: a control that exists in the markup but is not
  drawn, text a stylesheet or a missing font ate on the way to the screen,
  and — the case no DOM-based tool can find, because there is nothing in the
  DOM to find — content painted into a canvas or baked into an image, which a
  person can read and a screen reader cannot. No OCR, no new dependency, and
  deterministic. See [docs/rendering.md](docs/rendering.md).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install experience-validation-engine

# 30-second offline demo (no browser needed):
npx eve run mock: --persona curious-explorer --steps 25
open .eve-output/report.html

# Real site (the browser ships with EVE; this fetches Chromium itself):
npx playwright install chromium
npx eve run https://staging.your-app.example.com \
  --persona impatient-user --goal "figure out what this product does"

# Read what your software *produces*, not just what it does:
npx eve read ./docs/getting-started.md --persona first-time-user
npx eve read ./deck.md --genre presentation
npx eve read ./metrics.csv --goal "did signups grow"
git log --oneline | npx eve read - --genre transcript

# Talk to something that answers back:
npx eve chat mock: --goal "get a refund for being charged twice"
npx eve chat https://api.example.com/chat --goal "reset my password"
```

Programmatic:

```ts
import { EveSession, PlaywrightAdapter, writeReports } from "experience-validation-engine";

const result = await new EveSession({
  adapter: new PlaywrightAdapter(),
  startUrl: "https://staging.example.com",
  persona: "first-time-user",
  goal: "sign up for an account",
  goalSuccessSignals: ["welcome"],
  seed: 42,                      // same seed → same session
}).run();

await writeReports(result, ".eve-output");
```

Sessions are **deterministic**: (app state, persona, seed) fully determine
the run — so a changed path after a deploy is a real behavioral change in
your product, and different seeds sample different plausible humans.

## Beyond one operator (Phase 2)

EVE is also a research platform for autonomous human-experience simulation.
Opt-in systems (all backwards-compatible — default behavior is unchanged):

- **A deeper mind** — selective **attention** (fixations, change/inattentional
  blindness), **utility-based decisions** whose weights are driven by emotion,
  a full **expectation engine** (predict outcome/destination/latency/feedback,
  then score the surprise), a **Cognitive Load Index**, and a **trust model**
  that builds slowly and breaks fast. Turn it on with `cognitive: true`.
- **Long-term memory** — the operator remembers an app between sessions and
  gets measurably more efficient (e.g. 7 → 5 → 5 steps), with **Learning
  Rate**, **Retention**, **Recognition-vs-Recall** and a **forgetting curve**.
- **Social & cultural personas** — professional overlays (doctor, lawyer,
  accountant…) and locale profiles (reading direction, date/currency, privacy).
- **Behavioral regression** — catch UX regressions that keep functional tests
  green: the app still works, but now takes more clicks, hesitation, or trust.
- **Experience forecasting** — predict where future users will struggle and
  which changes lift completion most.
- **An AI panel** — an independent **design critic**, a **moderator** that
  finds cross-persona consensus, a **product manager** that writes a
  prioritized backlog, and a **developer** that emits GitHub/Linear/Jira
  tickets.
- **Collaborative sessions** — multi-operator handoffs and approval chains.
- **A benchmark suite** — known-quality apps EVE must rank correctly
  (`eve benchmark`), its standing construct-validity check.

```bash
eve run mock: --persona first-time-user --cognitive --utility --panel
eve run mock: --remember .eve-memory.json --seed 1   # run repeatedly → watch it learn
eve benchmark                                         # validate the instrument
```

## Use it inside your AI assistant

EVE ships an **MCP server** (`eve-mcp`), so any Model Context Protocol client —
Claude Desktop, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot —
can drive it directly. Your assistant gains tools like `eve_run_session`,
`eve_list_personas`, and `eve_benchmark`, then *"run an EVE session against
`mock:` as a first-time user"* just works (offline, no browser).

```bash
# Claude Code — one line:
claude mcp add eve -- npx -y experience-validation-engine eve-mcp

# Claude Code — or install as a plugin (bundles the /eve skill):
#   /plugin marketplace add fernandogarzaaa/experience-validation-engine
#   /plugin install eve
```

For every other client, drop this into its MCP config:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "eve": {
  "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "experience-validation-engine", "eve-mcp"]
} } }
```

See the [Integration Guide](docs/integrations.md) for per-platform config
(Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code) and the full tool reference.
