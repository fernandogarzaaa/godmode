 * The operator's memory, split — as human memory is — into subsystems:

 * - Episodic memory: what happened — screens visited, actions taken and how
 *   they turned out. Subject to forgetting.
 * - Semantic memory: generalized knowledge extracted from episodes ("the
 *   gear icon opens settings here", "Ctrl+S saves"). Discovered features and
 *   learned shortcuts live here.
 * - Spatial memory: a map of the product — which screens exist and which
