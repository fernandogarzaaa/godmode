/**
 * McpAdapter — perceives an MCP server as a textual surface.
 *
 * **Phase 2: kernel-native.** The adapter's source of truth is the
 * modality-variant kernel (`src/core/kernel.ts`): a structured tool catalog
 * with stable affordance identity, typed surface signals (tool results,
 * protocol errors, notifications, termination), and a single `mcp.invoke`
 * kernel action carrying typed arguments. The legacy browser-flavored
 * snapshot below is now the *deprecated web view*, derived from the same
 * state for pre-kernel consumers:
 *
 * | Kernel concept      | MCP native                    | Deprecated web view          |
 * | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
 * | frame identity      | address `mcp:<target>`, label | `url` / `title`              |
 * | affordances         | `mcp.tool` (schemaPath)       | menu lines (char cells)      |
 * | tool result         | `tool-result` signal (full)   | truncated frame lines        |
 * | tool/protocol error | `error` / `tool-result`       | a fake modal "dialog"        |
 * | `list_changed`      | `notification` signal         | a re-rendered frame          |
 * | `tools/call`        | one `mcp.invoke` action       | form fill + Enter            |
 *
 * Everything the adapter perceives is something a legitimate MCP client user
 * could see: the advertised catalog, the schemas, and the results of calls
 * they made. Server internals, logs and source stay out of bounds, exactly
 * as with the browser adapters.
 *
 * The Phase-1 projection strains this retires are logged in
 * `docs/projection-debt-ledger.md` (items 1–6); the web view is kept for
 * compatibility, warts included.
