/**
 * MCP client connector — the transport layer for evaluating MCP servers.
 *
 * EVE *is* an MCP server (`src/mcp/`), so the official SDK is already a
 * runtime dependency; this module uses its client half to connect to a
 * *target* server. Two transports are supported:
 *
 * - stdio (`node server.js --flag`, the must-have): the target is spawned as
 *   a subprocess, exactly how MCP hosts launch servers.
 * - Streamable HTTP (`http://` / `https://` URLs): for servers that are
 *   already running.
 *
 * Everything here is a *client of the subject under evaluation* — it is the
 * evaluation equivalent of the browser driver, not a privileged channel.
 * The {@link McpConnection} interface is deliberately narrow so tests can
 * substitute an in-process fixture server over `InMemoryTransport` without
 * spawning anything.
