/**
 * Choice-set recording (Phase 3 calibration substrate).
 *
 * What alternatives were available at the moment of decision — recorded,
 * never invented. The evidence ladder is strict:
 *
 * - `heuristic-ordered`: cascade order + eligibility + salience scores.
 *   NO probabilities (the cascade never computes any).
 * - `probabilistic`: utility scores + real softmax probabilities.
 * - `deterministic-single`: exactly one eligible candidate.
 *
 * Builders are pure mappings over data the policy already computed: they
 * consume no RNG and change no decision. Branches that select without
 * scoring (dialogs, loading, abandonment) record nothing — absence explicit.
