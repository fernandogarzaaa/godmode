 * The default, fully-offline decision policy.
 *
 * Models a human's moment-to-moment choice as a priority cascade — the same
 * one people actually run:
 *
 *  1. Something is blocking me (dialog) → deal with it.
 *  2. The page is still loading → wait (patience permitting).
 *  3. I'm too frustrated to continue → give up.
 *  4. I haven't looked at this screen yet → read it first.
 *  5. There's a field the task needs filled → fill it.
 *  6. Something looks worth clicking → click the most salient thing.
 *  7. There's more page below → scroll.
 *  8. I'm going in circles → go back.
 *  9. Nothing left → step back or give up.
 *
 * On a document surface (`src/humanity/`) the priorities are a reader's
 * rather than an operator's, and {@link HeuristicCognition.handleDocumentSurface}
 * runs its own cascade instead. In a dialogue (`src/conversation/`) they are
 * a speaker's, and {@link HeuristicCognition.handleConversationSurface} runs
 * that one.
 *
 * All stochastic choices go through the session RNG so runs are reproducible.
