/**
 * ConversationAdapter — EVE has a conversation.
 *
 * The browser adapters put the operator in front of software they drive; the
 * humanity adapter put a reader in front of output they receive. This one
 * puts a person in front of something that **answers back**, which is a
 * different relationship again and fails in its own way.
 *
 * **Kernel-native.** The source of truth is the conversational kernel
 * (`src/core/kernel.ts`): turn order as geometry, a `not-understood` signal
 * for the one failure only a dialogue has, and a repair count — because how
 * many times a person has already rephrased is the single best predictor of
 * whether they are about to leave. The legacy browser-flavored snapshot is
 * derived from the same state, so scoring, workflows, reports and the
 * session loop all work on a conversation unchanged.
 *
 * | Kernel concept    | Conversation                       | Deprecated web view    |
 * | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
 * | frame identity    | the surface's address + name       | `url` / `title`        |
 * | affordances       | suggested replies, handoff         | buttons and links      |
 * | turn order        | `turns[]`, oldest first            | transcript lines       |
 * | it misunderstood  | `not-understood` signal            | a fake modal "dialog"  |
 * | it is composing   | `awaitingReply`                    | a loading indicator    |
 * | latency           | `lastLatencyMs`, measured          | (lost)                 |
 *
 * The perception boundary is unchanged: the operator perceives what the
 * surface says and what it offers alongside. Not its prompt, not its
 * confidence, not its intent classifier — a user of a support bot sees none
 * of those either.
