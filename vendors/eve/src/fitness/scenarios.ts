/**
 * The scenario suite a mutation is measured against.
 *
 * EVE owns benchmark scenarios, and the three reference apps in
 * `benchmarks/apps.ts` are the instrument: they implement the same task at
 * three deliberately different quality levels, and `validateBenchmarks` asserts
 * EVE scores them in strict order. That internal discrimination is what makes
 * a fitness delta mean anything — an instrument that cannot separate a good
 * app from a bad one cannot detect that a mutation made an operator worse.
 *
 * A fitness measurement therefore reuses the validated instrument rather than
 * inventing scenarios for the purpose. Registering a scenario is possible (see
 * {@link registerScenario}) and is how a deployment measures mutations against
 * its own product, but the built-in three are the calibrated default.
