/**
 * HumanityAdapter — EVE sits down and reads.
 *
 * Every other adapter puts the operator in front of something they *drive*.
 * This one puts a reader in front of something they *receive*: a report, a
 * deck, a dashboard export, a `--help` screen, a stack trace, an API payload.
 * That is most of what software actually shows people, and until now EVE
 * could not experience any of it.
 *
 * **Kernel-native.** The adapter's source of truth is the document kernel
 * (`src/core/kernel.ts`): reading order as geometry, sections as the unit
 * the reader turns between, and typed signals for the two things that
 * genuinely happen while reading — reaching the end, and hitting something
 * you do not understand. The legacy browser-flavored snapshot is derived
 * from the same state, so every Phase-1 consumer (scoring, workflows,
 * reports, the session loop) works on a reading session unchanged.
 *
 * | Kernel concept   | Reading                              | Deprecated web view      |
 * | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
 * | frame identity   | address + section title              | `url` / `title`          |
 * | affordances      | blocks, references, next/prev section | text lines + links       |
 * | comprehension    | `comprehension-gap` signal            | a fake modal "dialog"    |
 * | end of artifact  | `end-of-content` signal              | a final line of text     |
 * | reading position | section index + blocks read           | scroll offset            |
 *
 * The perception boundary is unchanged and, if anything, tighter: a reader
 * perceives the artifact's rendered content and nothing else. There is no
 * source, no file metadata, no build information — a person handed a PDF
 * cannot see who generated it either.
