/**
 * Experience Validation Engine (EVE)
 * "AI that experiences software like a human."
 *
 * Public API surface. See docs/api-reference.md for the guided tour.
 *
 * Two subsystems are reached through their own subpath exports rather than
 * this barrel, because both declare types whose names (`Observation`,
 * `Experience`, `Provenance`, `Measurement`) are deliberately generic on the
 * wire and would collide with EVE's own vocabulary if flattened into one
 * namespace:
 *
 * - `experience-validation-engine/protocol` — the CP/1 binding, by which EVE,
 *   ADAM and AXIOM-AETHER exchange documents as one organism.
 * - `experience-validation-engine/fitness` — counterfactual fitness
 *   measurement, EVE's role in the developmental lifecycle.
